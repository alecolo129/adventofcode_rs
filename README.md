# Advent of Code - Rust Workspace

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in Rust. 
Each day of the event is organized as a separate binary project.

## Project Structure

Each project `day_X` has:
- `main.rs`: The Rust program that solves the problem for the day.
- `input.txt`: The input provided for the challenge.
- `description.md`: A markdown file with the problem description.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed on your system. 

### Cloning Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent_of_code.git
cd advent_of_code
